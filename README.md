# Scene-Practice
Made Fall 2021

I made this as part of my digital arts & sciences class. 
We were practicing rendering full scenes of imported models.

This project was made with Processing, a free graphical library and IDE that uses Java. Be sure to rename the root folder to Project5 if you'd like to run it for yourself.
